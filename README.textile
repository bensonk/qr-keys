h1. QR Keys

A project to explore the use of QR codes to store ssh keys. 

h3. qr-keys.sh

bc. ./qr-keys.sh ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub

Depends on "libqrencode":http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.en.html and
"ImageMagick":http://www.imagemagick.org/ CLI tools.

This tool will take an ssh keypair (e.g. id_dsa and id_dsa.pub) and generate
two QR Codes and an HTML document that embeds them.  It will make a naive
attempt to open the html document for easy printing; this currently only works
on OSX.
